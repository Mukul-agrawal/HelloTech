 ## :trophy: Brief introduction about a project:
<br>
Technology and electronics brands compete with the big players â€“ like Apple and Dell â€“ as well as well-known disrupters like Fit Bit. Beyond the challenging competitors, there are ever-changing product innovations in this industry and the ecommerce industry itself is constantly evolving. The best technology and electronics sites are poised to cash-in on this $350 million industry, giving consumers the online shopping experience theyâ€™re looking for.
<br><br> 
We will be using HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP, MERN Stack technologies in our project. For database, we will be using mongodb. 
<br><br>
This system provides a lot of features to manage the products in a very well manner. This system contains a lot of advance modules which makes the back end system very powerful. We combine attractive web design for users, simple web browsing, where customers can easily find what they are looking for, with coherence with the company brand image.
 <br><br>
 Retail revenue from consumer electronics/technology sales in the U.S. is projected to top $350 billion in 2018. If youâ€™re like most businesses in this fast-growing and highly competitive market segment, youâ€™re looking for an edge to capture the largest possible share of this revenue. That edge is ecommerce excellence.
If you expect to grow your business this year, you need to give customers an exceptional online shopping experience.
<br><br>
Our methodology is designed to help you take maximum advantage of the internet technologies. It incorporate all aspects related to your website and allows us to ensure that the final product is of the highest standards. Below are the steps we will take to ensure that all your deliverables are completed in time.The first step for us is to analyze ecommerce related user requirements. What will be the purpose of their visit to our website, what is the primary goal of our website, how can our team best cater to their fitness related ideas. Many such questions are analyzed for the Needs Analysis stage. We will analyze our online target audience and assess our differentiation strategy to best attract our visitors.Based on the analysis, we will determine the factors that will best serve our website. We look at the trends in the market to ensure that we have the well-known technology, components and elements.We consider this stage to be one of the most crucial factors in any project. We will justify every single aspect of the design to ensure that each element is serving a specific need and the website is truly designed to attract, retain and enhance the end user-experience. Many thought processes and brainstorming will go into this process to create a design that is serving your existing needs as well as is sustainable with the future growth. The finalized concepts or templates will then be used to give you an understanding of how internal content intensive pages will look.Once we have received concrete idea of the detailed design, we proceed to the development phase. In development phase we will use MERN stack.
